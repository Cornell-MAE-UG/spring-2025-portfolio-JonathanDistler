## About Me

My name is Jonathan Distler, and I am a rising Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am interested in robotics (especially soft-robotics) and aerospace/cyberscruity policy. I am currently working on the Cornell Hyperloop Project team and helping to conduct research in Dr. Gregory Falco's Adversary Lab.
