During my time at Virginia Tech in the Biomechanics Lab under Dr. Noel Naughton, I contributed to groundbreaking advancements in soft robotics:

- **Prototyping Methods**: Developed innovative approaches for a soft-robotic snake, focusing on precision and efficiency.
- **H-Bot Control System**: Designed and implemented a control system to synchronize and time-stamp ultrasound images of octopus movements, employing MATLAB and serial communication techniques to achieve highly accurate surface scans of soft tissue.
- **Soft Robotic Muscle Prototype**: Collaborated with a research team to engineer a novel prototype capable of expanding and contracting to exact diameters and lengths. This achievement involved rigorous material property analysis and problem-solving.

Below is an image of the H-Bot control system:
