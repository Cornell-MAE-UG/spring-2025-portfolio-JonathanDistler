As part of a class project for Mechanical Design (MAE 2250). I was tasked with drawing and then developing an accurate CAD model for a household object. I chose the Seiko SRPG 41. 


My initial process involved dimensioning each component of the watch, from the circumference and diameter of the face to the depth of the dial. Then, I developed unique "parts" for each system, involving core geometries and time-saving processes (ie mirroring). Then, I combined all of the unique "parts" together into one functional CAD model. Finally, I added "joints" that helped define the real-world physics of the watch.
