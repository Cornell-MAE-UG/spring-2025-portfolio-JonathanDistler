# Mechanical Design Class Project (MAE 2250)

As part of a class project for **Mechanical Design (MAE 2250)**, I was tasked with drawing and then developing an accurate CAD model for a household object. I chose the **Seiko SRPG 41**.

## Initial Process

1. **Dimensioning Components**: 
   - Measured each part of the watch, from the circumference and diameter of the face to the depth of the dial.

2. **Developing Unique "Parts"**:
   - Created unique "parts" for each system using core geometries and time-saving processes (e.g., mirroring).

3. **Assembling the CAD Model**:
   - Combined all the unique "parts" into a single, functional CAD model.
   - Added "joints" to define the real-world physics of the watch.

## Design Approach

I focused on understanding how the components interacted with each other. Everything revolved around the **watch face**:
- The hands, straps, and tuner all connected to the watch face.
- Started by sketching the watch face and gradually assembling the other components.

### Workflow Strategy

- Built each object with a basic design.
- After assembling, refined the details in the individual sketches.
- In the future, I plan to build all pieces individually before assembly to save time on joints. 

## Challenges Faced

- **Watch Band Design**:
  - Struggled with the angular constraints of the watch bands.
  - Found it easier to constrain one side fully and then mirror it across the center of the strap.
---

- **Repeated Tasks**:
  - Making individual holes in the watch band was time-consuming.
  - Hope to find a more efficient solution for repetitive tasks in the future.
