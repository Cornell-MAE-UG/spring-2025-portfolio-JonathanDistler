I contributed to a cross-disciplinary research initiative aimed at developing a conceptual framework for utilizing drones to deliver food to rural, food-insecure communities. This collaboration involved faculty from Virginia Tech specializing in nutrition and mechanical engineering. The resulting paper underwent peer review and was presented at the IEEE Mipro Conference held in Opatija, Croatia.
